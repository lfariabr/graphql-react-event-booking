# GraphQL Resolvers Refactoring

## Overview
This document outlines the refactoring process we performed on the GraphQL resolvers to improve code organization, maintainability, and reusability.

## Before Refactoring
- All resolvers were in a single `index.ts` file
- Transformation logic was mixed with resolver logic
- No clear separation of concerns
- Code duplication in data transformation
- Harder to maintain and test

## After Refactoring

### 1. File Structure
```
graphql/
  resolvers/
    index.ts          # Combines all resolvers
    events.ts         # Event-related resolvers
    users.ts          # User-related resolvers
    bookings.ts       # Booking-related resolvers
    transformers.ts   # Data transformation utilities
```

### 2. Key Improvements

#### a. Separation of Concerns
- **Resolvers**: Each domain (events, users, bookings) has its own file
- **Transformers**: Common data transformation logic is centralized
- **Index**: Clean combination of all resolvers

#### b. Reusable Transformers
Created utility functions in `transformers.ts`:
- `transformEvent`: Standardizes event object format
- `transformUser`: Handles user data transformation and password masking
- `transformBooking`: Standardizes booking object format

#### c. Type Safety (Potential Enhancement)
The structure now makes it easier to add TypeScript interfaces:
```typescript
interface IEvent {
  _id: string;
  title: string;
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### d. Error Handling
Consistent error handling patterns across all resolvers:
- Try/catch blocks
- Specific error messages
- Proper error propagation

### 3. Code Examples

#### Before (Single File)
```typescript
// index.ts
const rootValue = {
  events: async () => {
    // ... implementation
  },
  createEvent: async () => {
    // ... implementation
  },
  // ... many more resolvers
};
```

#### After (Modular Structure)
```typescript
// events.ts
export const eventResolvers = {
  events: async () => { /* ... */ },
  createEvent: async () => { /* ... */ }
};

// users.ts
export const userResolvers = {
  users: async () => { /* ... */ },
  createUser: async () => { /* ... */ }
};

// index.ts
import { eventResolvers } from './events';
import { userResolvers } from './users';

export default {
  ...eventResolvers,
  ...userResolvers
};
```

### 4. Benefits

1. **Maintainability**
   - Smaller, focused files
   - Easier to locate and update specific functionality

2. **Reusability**
   - Common functions like transformers can be used across resolvers
   - Reduces code duplication

3. **Testability**
   - Easier to write unit tests for individual resolvers
   - Transformers can be tested in isolation

4. **Scalability**
   - New resolvers can be added without modifying existing files
   - Team members can work on different resolvers simultaneously

5. **Readability**
   - Clear separation between different concerns
   - Consistent patterns across the codebase

### 5. Potential Future Improvements

1. **Type Safety**
   - Add TypeScript interfaces for all data types
   - Use GraphQL code generation for type safety

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Inject models and services for better testability

3. **Error Handling Middleware**
   - Centralize error handling for common cases

4. **Input Validation**
   - Add validation for all inputs

5. **Logging**
   - Add structured logging
   - Include request IDs for better traceability

## Conclusion
This refactoring has significantly improved the codebase by:
- Organizing code by domain
- Separating concerns
- Reducing duplication
- Making the code more maintainable and testable
- Setting up a scalable structure for future development
