## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)
- npm or yarn

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/booqme.git
cd booqme
```

2. Install backend dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Install frontend dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```
MONGO_DB_USERNAME=your_mongodb_username
MONGO_DB_PASSWORD=your_mongodb_password
MONGO_DB=your_mongodb_cluster_name
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Backend
```bash
# From the root directory
npm run dev
```
The backend server will run on http://localhost:8000

### Frontend
```bash
# From the frontend directory
npm run dev
```
The frontend application will run on http://localhost:3000

## üì± Application Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- Express server with GraphQL API endpoint
- Authentication middleware for protected routes
- MongoDB models for Users, Events, and Bookings
- GraphQL schema and resolvers for data operations
- DataLoader for efficient data fetching

### Frontend Architecture
- Next.js pages for routing
- React components for UI
- Cross-page state management with localStorage
- Multi-booking system that stores booking data locally

## üíæ Data Management

The application implements a multi-booking system that stores an array of bookings in localStorage under the key 'userBookings' while maintaining backward compatibility with the single 'latestBooking' implementation. This approach allows:

- Booking multiple events rather than restricting to a single booking
- Instant visual feedback on booking status
- Cross-page state persistence
